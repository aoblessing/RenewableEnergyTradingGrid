## Overview

Renewable Energy Trading Grid (RETG) is a decentralized marketplace built on the Stacks blockchain that enables peer-to-peer trading of renewable energy credits with real-time settlement and automatic grid balancing. By leveraging Stacks' unique capabilities and Bitcoin's security, RETG creates a transparent, efficient, and secure platform for renewable energy trading.

## Why Stacks?

RETG utilizes several key features that make Stacks the ideal blockchain for this implementation:

- **Bitcoin Security**: Energy credit transactions are secured by Bitcoin's robust network through Stacks' PoX consensus
- **Smart Contracts**: Clarity smart contracts enable automated grid balancing and instant settlements
- **Scalability**: Stacks' layer-2 solution provides the throughput needed for real-time energy trading
- **Transparency**: All energy trades are verifiable on-chain while maintaining privacy where needed

## Core Features

1. **Real-time Energy Credit Trading**
   - Instant peer-to-peer trading of renewable energy credits
   - Automated price discovery based on supply and demand
   - Smart contract-enabled instant settlements

2. **Automated Grid Balancing**
   - Smart contracts monitor and maintain grid stability
   - Automatic adjustment of energy distribution
   - Real-time optimization of energy flow

3. **Micro-grid Management**
   - Support for localized energy trading communities
   - Efficient energy distribution within micro-grids
   - Reduced transmission losses

4. **Smart Metering Integration**
   - Direct integration with IoT energy meters
   - Real-time consumption and production tracking
   - Automated billing and settlements

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- `energy-credit.clar`: Manages energy credit tokens
- `trading-engine.clar`: Handles order matching and execution
- `grid-balance.clar`: Maintains grid stability and optimization
- `meter-oracle.clar`: Interfaces with IoT energy meters
